- Incorporating external data (Oil Prices)

## 📁 Tasks Covered

### 📊 Task 1: Exploratory Sales Analysis
- Trend, seasonality, day/week analysis
- Visualizations (line & bar charts)

### 🔮 Task 2: Simple Moving Average Forecast
- 7-day & 30-day moving averages
- Actual vs Forecast comparison

### 📈 Task 3: Linear Regression Modeling
- Features: Date components, promotions
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R²

### 🧠 Intermediate: Feature Engineering & Lag Features
