📊 Final SIP Project InternBoot Internship

The project was divided into different stages:

🔹 Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Loaded and cleaned large datasets using Pandas.

Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, max, min, std).

Visualized sales trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn (daily, monthly, weekday analysis).

Found seasonality patterns and missing values.


🔹 Task 2: Simple Sales Forecast with Moving Averages

Implemented 7-day & 30-day rolling averages.

Compared actual vs forecasted sales.

Smoothed trends using moving average.


🔹 Task 3: Linear Regression for Sales Prediction

Extracted features: year, month, day, promotions.

Built and evaluated a regression model using Scikit-learn.

Visualized actual vs predicted sales.

⚡ Intermediate Level Tasks
1️⃣ Feature Engineering:

Created new features like holidays, weekends, and lag features (previous week/month sales).


2️⃣ Multiple Regression:

Trained model with promotions, holidays & lag features.

Evaluated using MSE, RMSE, MAE, R².


3️⃣ Time Series Regression:

Applied Polynomial Regression for trend.

Used month & holiday indicators for seasonality.

Improved accuracy compared to baseline regression.



---

🚀 Advanced Level Tasks
🔹 Regularized Regression (Ridge/Lasso):

Implemented Ridge & Lasso to avoid overfitting.

Compared feature importance across models.


🔹 External Data Integration:

Merged oil price dataset with sales data.

Observed how external economic factors influence forecasting.

Achieved better prediction accuracy using external features.
